# Claude Project 1: Interactive Web Development Learning

This repository serves as a practical exploration of web development and GitHub workflow management, created through an interactive collaboration with Claude AI. The project demonstrates the process of building and managing a simple yet professional website while learning various web development concepts.

I must give credit to David Andrej and his youtube video "Build Anything with Claude Agents: Here's How"

Having been an avid AI user I see videos often on new capabilties but I think this one (MCP) by far takes the cake.

It is an almost start to finish AI implementation that allows claude to access all relevent information (OS + latest news/websites + data + Github) and manage these different aspects just through prompting.
