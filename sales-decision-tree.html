                    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                    <p>The project follows philosophies outlined in <em>Poke the Bear</em> and <em>Cold Calling Sucks and That's Why It's Important</em>.</p>
                    
                    <p>The goal was to stay on top of a talk track and ensure that when I received feedback during call reviews, I could codify it for future use.</p>
                    
                    <p>It provided a way to <strong>standardize talk tracks</strong>, allowing for increased confidence in sales calls.</p>
                    
                    <p>The idea was to integrate <strong>data analytics</strong> to A/B test the sequence and evaluate the performance of individual nodes.</p>
                    
                    <p>The project had a limitation: it was <strong>difficult to implement the HTML script</strong> whenever I wanted to make changes, as it wasn't dynamic.</p>
                    
                    <p>The <strong>node structure</strong> (e.g., 2YYN, 2YNY) was rigid and hard to monitor, which made data processing capabilities less effective.</p>
